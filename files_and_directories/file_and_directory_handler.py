def move_files_by_globstr_from_exec_code(file_strings, destination_directories):

    """
    Function that moves files selected by part of the file name,
    from the directory that this code is being called
    to the desired directory or directories.
    It uses name globbing (or main globbing, Path(path).glob attribute).
    
    There are four cases of string globbing inside the main globbing:
      1. The string is fixed.
          Then on the main globbing no asterisk is needed.
      2. The string has a particular beggining.
          Then on the main globbing the asterisk goes at the end.
      3. The string has a particular ending.
          Then on the main globbing the asterisk goes at the beggining.
      4. The string is composed by several particular substrings.
          Several asterisks are placed along the string.
    
    Because these reasons and for practical purposes and simplicity,
    the main globbing does not include any asterisk placement case,
    so the strings are required already to have asterisks.
    This functionality is applied to similar functions in this module.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    file_strings : str or list
          String or list of strings that identify the desired files.
          Accepts file name extension globbing.
    destination_directories : str or list
          A string of the directory name or a list
          containing several directories where to move the matching files.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extensions : str or list
          A string of the file extension or a list of extensions,
          WITHOUT THE POINT MARKER in any case.
    destination_directories : str or list
          A string of the directory name or a list
          containing several directories where to move the matching files.
    find_hidden_files : bool
          Controls whether to seek for hidden files in the given directory
          by 'destination_directories' parameter. Defaults False.
    recursive_in_depth : bool
          Applies only to the case in which both of the first parameters are lists.
          Default value is True.
          Behavior explanation is shown below.
    
    This function distinguishes four cases:
    
      1. Both file names and directories are lists.
          1.1 recursive_in_depth=True
              Then it is understood that each file
              corresponds to multiple directories and they have to be
              recursively removed from all of them.
          1.2 recursive_in_depth=False
              Then it is understood that each file
              corresponds to a single directory, and they are removed from
              the given directories.
              File and directory lists have to be of the same length;
              throws and error otherwise.
      2. The file names are contained in a list but there is
          a single directory.
              Then each file will be removed from that directory.
      3. The extension is a string and directories are contained in a list.
              Then the matching files will be recursively removed
              from each of the directories.
      4. None of them are lists.
              Then the matching files will simply be removed from that directory.

def rename_objects(relative_paths, renaming_relative_paths):

    """
    Function that renames files specified by their absolute paths.
    
    In fact, os.rename can also perform the same tasks as shutil.move does,
    therefore functions 'move_files_by_ext_from_exec_code' and
    'move_files_by_globstr_from_exec_code', including the fact that,
    besides moving a directory or file, it includes the option to
    rename thereof at the destination directory, i.e. altering the
    ultimate part of the absolute path.
    
    However, as a matter of distinguishing among the main usages of the modules,
    and to invoke simple operations, this function will be used
    such that each file or directory will be given another name,
    without altering the absolute path.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    relative_paths: str or list
          String or list of strings that identify the desired files/directories,
          i.e. the absolute path.
    renaming_relative_paths : str or list
          A string of the file/directory name or a list containing
          several files/directories, i.e the renamed BUT UNALTERED absolute path.
    
    This function distinguishes two cases:
    
      1. Both file names and directories are lists.
          Then it is understood that each string file or directory
          corresponds to another single file or directory and
          it is renamed as commanded. 
          File and directory lists have to be of the same length;
          throws and error otherwise.
      2. None of them are lists.
          Then the matching files will simply be renamed.
